## [1.0.0](https://github.com/koenhendriks/ha-eplucon/releases/1.0.0) - 2024-08-28
### Added
- Initial release of the Eplucon Home Assistant Integration.
- Support for retrieving real-time device information from the Eplucon API.
- Added `DeviceDTO`, `RealtimeInfoDTO`, and `CommonInfoDTO` for structured data management.
- Integration with Home Assistant's sensor platform.
- Automatic sensor entity creation based on Eplucon devices and their real-time data.
- Configuration via Home Assistant's UI, including token-based authentication.
- Data fetching and update mechanism using Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator`.

- Addressed bug with entity setup causing entities to be marked as "no longer provided" after restart.

### Known Issues
- Some device data may be returned as empty lists (e.g., `heatpump` data) due to API response inconsistencies.
- Minor delays in data updates may occur depending on API response time.
